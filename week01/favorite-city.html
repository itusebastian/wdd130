  <h1>My Favorite City</h1>
  <p>My favorite city is Ibarra, Ecuador. It is a small mountain town at the foot of the Imbabura
    volcano. There is so much nature all around, including lakes that people can visit. I love how
    close it is to some of my favorite places. From Ibarra, we can see other high mountains like
    Cayambe and Cotacachi, where Lake Cuicocha is located.</p>

  <p>Ibarra has a deep connection with me because I grew up there. My mom always taught me to visit
    natural places like lakes and rivers, and it’s amazing how much there is to explore in the area.
    I love the artists from the region and how much beautiful work they create thanks to the
    inspiration of the Andes.</p>
